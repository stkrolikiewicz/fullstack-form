## 1. Install dependencies
Install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

## 2. Run the app

### a) development mode
Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


### b) build the app
For better performance build the app and then start it on your local server:

```bash
npm run build
```
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Open localhost
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## REMEMBER ABOUT THE SERVER
Be sure that server is also running at port `8080`, otherwise the app won't send answers to the database.
